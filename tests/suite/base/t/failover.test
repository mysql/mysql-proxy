-- this test 
-- * starts two backends
-- * sets and verifies IDs in the backends
-- * reconnects and verifies that the IDs are still in place
-- * stop the first backend and verifies that queries against it fail
-- * checks that new connects end up on the second backend

connect (conn1,127.0.0.1,root,,,14040);
connect (conn2,127.0.0.1,root,,,14040);

connection conn1;
SET ID 1;
GET ID;

connection conn2;

GET ID;

-- check if we end up on the the right backend

-- now kill the backend and wait until it is down
